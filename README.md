# Process Control Block (PCB) Emulation

This is a program that emulates how a process control block works.
It is a basic linked list of simple process information stored in memory.

## Usage

Just type:
`./build/pcb`
in your terminal.

## What the demonstration shows:

  - Successful insertion into list.
  - Successful rejection of duplicate insertion.
  - Successful removal from list.
  - Successful rejection of non-present element removal.

## Note

This was made for a university assignment.
Was entirely made by me, however ChatGPT was used to help with some error handling.
